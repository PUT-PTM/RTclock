# RTC

## Overview
3 in 1!
Clock, stopwatch and alarm clock made on microcontroller STM32.

## Description
The project contains three modes. You can switch between the watch, the alarm clock and the stopwatch. When the hour reaches the one set in the alarm clock, the loudspeaker with specially prepared music will inform us about this. Four buttons are prepared for the functioning of the entire watch, and all necessary information is displayed on the display.

## Tools
* System Workbench for STM32
* Microcontroller STM32F4 DISCOVERY
* RTC DS3231SN
* LCD HD44780
* buttons
* speaker

## How to compile
